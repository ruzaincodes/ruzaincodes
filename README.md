I've been passionate about coding since I was six years old, starting with block-based programming in Scratch. By the age of eight, I was creating my own projects in Scratch and even secured first place at a digital fest! At nine, I began exploring hardware with Arduino and delving into Python and OpenCV, which introduced me to C++. By ten, I was immersed in various projects that combined hardware and software.

Today, I'm experimenting with NodeMCU and other hardware components, and I'm continuing to learn and grow my skills in programming.
